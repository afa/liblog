SubdomainRoutes Revision History

Version 0.3.0

* Added this revision history.
* Added #assert_recognizes_with_host and #assert_generates_with_host methods to
  ActionController::Assertions::RoutingAssertions, allowing testing of subdomain routes
  if you're into that sort of thing.
* Modified ActionController::Routing::Route#significant_keys to include the subdomain
  option in the case of model-based subdomain routes.
* Added ability to override default namespace and name prefix for model-based subdomain
  routes by passing :name option to the map.subdomain call.
* Updated README to describe how to test with subdomain routes.
